# Convulational_Neural_Networks

Project_MNIST is a python machine learning project where I use Neural networks and Convulational neural network to anlyze the MNIST data set and train the model to correctly recognize the digit patterns from 1000s of samples of differently written digits. I am also comparing the accuracy for both the models.


This is a python notebook, which could be run on the Google colab to view the results:
